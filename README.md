# Harvest epubcheck for the EPUB 3.3. CR report

This is a temporary repository to develop a TypeScript script to link the EPUB 3.3 specification to the epubcheck tests. Eventually, this script, as well as the result, will be migrated to W3C either as a separate repository or as part of the EPUB 3.3 specification repository.
